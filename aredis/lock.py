        """
        Create a new Lock instance named ``name`` using the Redis client
        supplied by ``redis``.

        ``timeout`` indicates a maximum life for the lock.
        By default, it will remain locked until release() is called.
        ``timeout`` can be specified as a float or integer, both representing
        the number of seconds to wait.

        ``sleep`` indicates the amount of time to sleep per loop iteration
        when the lock is in blocking mode and another client is currently
        holding the lock.

        ``blocking`` indicates whether calling ``acquire`` should block until
        the lock has been acquired or to fail immediately, causing ``acquire``
        to return False and the lock not being acquired. Defaults to True.
        Note this value can be overridden by passing a ``blocking``
        argument to ``acquire``.

        ``blocking_timeout`` indicates the maximum amount of time in seconds to
        spend trying to acquire the lock. A value of ``None`` indicates
        continue trying forever. ``blocking_timeout`` can be specified as a
        float or integer, both representing the number of seconds to wait.

        ``thread_local`` indicates whether the lock token is placed in
        thread-local storage. By default, the token is placed in thread local
        storage so that a thread only sees its token, not a token set by
        another thread. Consider the following timeline:

            time: 0, thread-1 acquires `my-lock`, with a timeout of 5 seconds.
                     thread-1 sets the token to "abc"
            time: 1, thread-2 blocks trying to acquire `my-lock` using the
                     Lock instance.
            time: 5, thread-1 has not yet completed. redis expires the lock
                     key.
            time: 5, thread-2 acquired `my-lock` now that it's available.
                     thread-2 sets the token to "xyz"
            time: 6, thread-1 finishes its work and calls release(). if the
                     token is *not* stored in thread local storage, then
                     thread-1 would see the token value as "xyz" and would be
                     able to successfully release the thread-2's lock.

        In some use cases it's necessary to disable thread local storage. For
        example, if you have code where one thread acquires a lock and passes
        that lock instance to a worker thread to release later. If thread
        local storage isn't disabled in this case, the worker thread won't see
        the token set by the thread that acquired the lock. Our assumption
        is that these cases aren't common and as such default to using
        thread local storage.

    Cluster lock is supposed to solve lock problem in redis cluster.
    Since high availability is provided by redis cluster using master-slave model,
    the kind of lock aims to solve the fail-over problem referred in distributed lock
    post given by redis official.

    Why not use Redlock algorithm provided by official directly?
    It is impossible to make a key hashed to different nodes
    in a redis cluster and hard to generate keys
    in a specific rule and make sure they do not migrated in cluster.
    In the worst situation, all key slots may exists in one node.
    Then the availability will be the same as one key in one node.
    For more discussion please see:
    https://github.com/NoneGG/aredis/issues/55

    My solution is to take advantage of `READONLY` mode of slaves to ensure
    the lock key is synced from master to N/2 + 1 of its slaves to avoid the fail-over problem.
    Since it is a single-key solution, the migration problem also do no matter.

    Please read these article below before using this cluster lock in your app.
