Release Notes
=============

master
------

    * add TCP Keep-alive support by passing use the `socket_keepalive=True`
      option. Finer grain control can be achieved using the
      `socket_keepalive_options` option which expects a dictionary with any of
      the keys (`socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE`, `socket.TCP_KEEPCNT`, `socket.TCP_KEEPINTVL`)
      and integers for values. Thanks Stefan Tjarks.

1.1.3
-----
