    """
    Pipelines provide a way to transmit multiple commands to the Redis server
    in one transmission.  This is convenient for batch processing, such as
    saving all the values in a list to Redis.

    All commands executed within a pipeline are wrapped with MULTI and EXEC
    calls. This guarantees all commands executed in the pipeline will be
    executed atomically.

    Any command raising an exception does *not* halt the execution of
    subsequent commands in the pipeline. Instead, the exception is caught
    and its instance is placed into the response list returned by execute().
    Code iterating over the response list should be able to deal with an
    instance of an exception as a potential value. In general, these will be
    ResponseError exceptions, such as those raised when issuing a command
    on a key of a different datatype.
